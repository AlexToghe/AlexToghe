Hello! 

My name is Alex Toghe and I am a curious and tenacious young engineer that has a passion for tech and software development.

My Education:
I graduated from Wayne State University with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I was the TA for Electronics 3570.
It was a pleasure to lead a class of 22 students through projects and weekly labs. At Wayne State I developed a passion for AI/Machine Learning.
I am planning on completing a Master's Degree in Computer Science.

Self Learning (Everyday):
Currently I am on the LeetCode Grind! I have some files with answers and step by step walk throughs for problems!
Since I have 2-3 years of experience with Python and 1 year with C++ and Matlab, I am learning front end develop using Javascript, CSS, HTML,
Node.js and React. I will have projects up as soon as they are completed.

My Experiences:
I worked in the Automotive Industry developing an AI that would classify people into weight classes. This classification would then change the force
of the airbag deployment in respect to the weight classification. Most of my work here was done in Python, C++, Matlab, and Arduino (Embedded Software). 
I worked with Linux based systems and used Python Libraries such as Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

Current Work:
Due to the layoffs that occured in early 2024, I was affected. The journey back into a tech job is on-going, however I am currently working as a
controls engineer on Baggage Handeling Systems. I use Allen Bradley's Studio 5000 to program PLC systems using ladder logic. I travel across
major airports to test, commission, and provide support for on going projects.
